# Assignment: HTML5, Accessibility & SEO Basics

## Overview

This assignment helps solidify the understanding of modern HTML5 structure while applying foundational concepts of web accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). The project is a simple, semantically correct web page that prioritizes both human and machine readabilityâ€”two pillars of great web design.

## Objective

To build a basic web page using HTML5 semantic tags, applying accessibility best practices and beginner-friendly SEO principles. The final output demonstrates a well-structured layout that supports screen readers and is optimized for discoverability.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases a practical understanding of the following core concepts:

* **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** The page is built using modern HTML5 landmarks such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create a meaningful and well-defined structure.

* **Logical Heading Hierarchy:** Content is organized with a clear heading hierarchy (e.g., a single `<h1>` followed by `<h2>` subheadings) to improve readability and SEO.

* **Web Accessibility (a11y):** Accessibility is enhanced through:
    * The use of the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
    * Descriptive `alt` text for images, making them accessible to screen readers.
    * Proper use of landmark elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.) to allow for easy navigation with assistive technologies.

* **On-Page SEO Basics:** The page is optimized for search engines by including:
    * A descriptive `<title>` tag.
    * A concise `<meta name="description">` tag to provide a summary for search engine results pages.

## Technology Stack
